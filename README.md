# SmartCityFramework
Smart city framework using IoT and Big Data

### Abstract
Information and Communications Technology is becoming increasingly pervasive to urban environments and providing the necessary basis for sustainability and resilience of the smart future cities. Often ICT tools for a smart city deal with different application domains e.g. home automation, healthcare, environment monitoring, energy and rarely provide an integrated information perspective to deal with sustainability and socioeconomic growth of the city. Smart cities can benefit from such information using Big data and often real-time cross-thematic, data collection, processing, integration and sharing through inter-operable services deployed in a Cloud environment. However, such information utilisation requires appropriate software tools, services and technologies to collect, store, analyse and visualise large amounts of data from the city environment, citizens and various departments and agencies at city scale.IoT datasets generated by smart healthcare, smart environment, and energy related data sets are used for analysis and evaluation. This framework presents a perspective on the smart cities focused Big data processing and analysis by proposing a Cloud-based analysis service that can be further developed to generate information intelligence and support decision-making in smart cities context.
